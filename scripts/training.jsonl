### Short Description for Dall-E
A small, agile goblin with keen eyes, dressed in dark, studded leather armor. He blends into the shadows of a bustling city, holding a dagger with a gleam of cunning and determination in his eyes. His posture suggests he's ready to spring into action at a moment's notice.

### Back Story
Grik the Cunning was once a member of a notorious goblin tribe in the forests far from Waterdeep. Driven by a lust for adventure and a hunger for riches, Grik left his tribe to seek his fortune in the city. However, the city's vastness and dangers quickly overwhelmed him, forcing him to rely on his instincts and skills as a rogue to survive. Grik now navigates Waterdeep's underbelly, stealing to sustain himself and always looking over his shoulder. His ultimate goal is to amass enough wealth and power to return to his tribe as a hero. However, the city has become a labyrinth of opportunities and threats, and Grik's journey is far from over.

### Affiliations or Relationships
Grik has made loose connections with various thieves' guilds and criminal elements in Waterdeep, though his trust in others is minimal. He occasionally works with other outcasts or criminals when it suits his needs, but his loyalty is primarily to himself.
